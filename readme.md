# Music Generation for MIDI Files

This project aims to explore the field of music generation using MIDI files. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a widely used file format for representing musical notes and events. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can generate new musical compositions based on existing MIDI files.

## Features

- MIDI file parsing: The project includes a module for parsing MIDI files and extracting musical information such as notes, chords, and tempo.
- Data preprocessing: The MIDI data is preprocessed to create a suitable input format for the machine learning models.
- Machine learning models: Machine learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are implemented to generate new musical compositions.
- User interface: A user-friendly interface is provided to interact with the music generation system and explore the generated compositions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Yuval728/music-generation.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare the MIDI dataset: Download a collection of MIDI files and place them in the `midi_songs` directory.
4. Preprocess the MIDI data: Run the preprocessing script to convert the MIDI files into a suitable input format for the models.
5. Train the models: Use the provided scripts to train the machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
6. Generate music: Once the models are trained, use the generation script to create new musical compositions.
